#04 Space-Shooter (Corrected Edition-Tracks properly for Git/Github.)

This is a project created for MSCH-G220 Game Technology, as our offical project-level intro to GODOT, as well as the beginning of user input, score keeping, scenes and particles!

This is a simple space shooter game serving as my main intro to the various functions of GODOT and their implementation. Here you'll find a responsive little spaceship for you to cruise around in as you dodge meteors and enemy lasers in space, with the ability to track your score and health! Have fun!
